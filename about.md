I am a 4th year graduate student at Queen's University. I am a PhD student in the Algebra and Number theory group at Queen's University working with Professor [Ram Murty](https://mast.queensu.ca/~murty/).

My research interests broadly fall into two themes: the analytic and arithmetic study of L-functions and obstructions that occur in Number Theory. Some specific problems I am interested in are:

<ul>
  <li>Artin's holomorphy conjecture. </li>
  <li>p-adic methods in analytic number theory.</li>
  <li>The Tate-Shafarevich group and failure of local​–global principles.</li>
  <li>The parity problem in sieve theory.  In particular, how it arises and methods to overcome it.</li>
</ul>
