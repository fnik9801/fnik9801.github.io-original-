I am a 4th year graduate student at Northwestern University. I am supervised by [Tuca Auffinger](http://math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/) and [Reza Gheissari](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gheissari/). My research is partially supported through a NSERC PGSD award. 

### More Information

I primarily work in high dimensional probability. In particular I am interested in behavior of spin glasses (static and dynamic), and applications of probability to high dimensional statistical problems.      
Previously I have worked on problems in Geometric Group theory and Geometric topology.
