I am a 4th year graduate student at Queen's University. I am a PhD student in the Algebra and Number theory group at Queen's University working with Professor [Ram Murty](https://mast.queensu.ca/~murty/).

My research interests broadly fall into two themes: the  analytic and arithmetic properties of L-functions and  obstructions that occur in Number Theory. Some specific problems I am interested in are:

- Artin's holomorphy conjecture.
- p-adic methods in analytic number theory.
- The Tate-Shafarevich group and failure of local​–global principles.
- The parity problem in sieve theory.  In particular, how it arises and methods to overcome it.
